Python API Challenge consisted of two parts: 

Part 1 required the creation of a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. OpenWeatherMap API was used to plot the following variables; temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed against latitude to visually see corrrelation and then run linear regression. 

Part 2 required creating a heat map of ideal vacation destination based on conditions of temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness. The map included pins with containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
